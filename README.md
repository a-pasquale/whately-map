# Stories from Whately, Massachusetts

This site is a compilation of interviews conducted with five Whately residents in the fall of 2018. The clips presented here include stories about growing up in Whately and reflections on how the town has changed in the last 80 years. These stories illuminate the experiences of being a kid in Whately in a time both very different and remarkably similar to today. The project invites you to reflect on your own relationship to the places you have lived throughout your life.
